# SMTP---Enumerate-Users-With-Bash-Script-Wordlist
This script connects to an SMTP server via telnet then sends a VRFY command to the SMTP server for each line in a wordlist file. 
The response from the server is then printed in the terminal.

Dependencies: Requires Bash, an empty line at the end of the wordlist, and telnet.

Instructions:

1. Open a Terminal

2. Use vim or an equivalent text editor to replace the IP with the target IP and the port with the target port, then change the filepath to that of your wordlist.

3. Run it in terminal.
